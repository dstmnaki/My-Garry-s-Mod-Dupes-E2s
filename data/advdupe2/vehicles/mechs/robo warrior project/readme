My latest mech base N.M.B.6 dubbed Project Robo Warrior or just RoboWarrior, it's a mech warrior style mech base so no flight or any of that op stuff, this is to balance the release of N.M.B.4

Controls:
WASD - Movement
Space - Jump
Control - Crouch
R - Toggle waist lock (switches between daktek and bfw, aka tank steering or strafing)
Mouse1 - Left weapon
Mouse2 - Right weapon
Mouse3 - Target lock (won't follow moving targets, useful with waist unlocked)
Alt - Third person
Mouse wheel - Zoom

For modeling:
On line 44, change "Edit = 0" to 1
Multiparent prop models to joints
Change "Edit = 1" back to 0
Respawn mech
