Hello, i am naki. This repo includes some of my dupes and e2s i've made in the past years.
I thought it would be a good idea to share them as i am leaving gmod.

Required addons:
[Wiremod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458)
[StarfallEX](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx)
[SProps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)
[Prop2Mesh (by shadowscion)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458909924)
[some sort of visual clipping addon (proper clip should work)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256491552)
[ACF2 (Power Armor's minigun will only work on Darkstorm sandbox)](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF)

These *should* be all the needed addons!
