Hello, i am naki. This repo includes some of my dupes and e2s i've made in the past years.
I thought it would be a good idea to share them as i am leaving gmod.


Required addons:

[Wiremod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458)

[StarfallEX (Github)](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx)

[SProps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)

[Prop2Mesh (by shadowscion)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458909924)

[some sort of visual clipping addon (proper clip should work)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256491552)

[ACF2 (Github, Power Armor's minigun will only work on Darkstorm sandbox)](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF)

Also the basilisk uses a custom thermal and requires my port of avp 2010 visions, you can toggle it by pressing mouse 4 or 5, can't remember sadly
[AVP2010 - Texturize Materials](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956665051)

These *should* be all the needed addons!
